### Quick glance 🔎
 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px"> Hi I'm Davide, a ML Engineer with 5 of experience in time series analysis and chatbot development and MLOps.
I am passionate about anything related to virtual assistants, chatbots, and NLP and how to use them ethically.
In my spare time, I like to go into details of chatbots and voice-controlled software because I believe that's the present and the near future of human-computer interaction.
Most of the AI project I've worked on struggled to get into and stay in production, that's why I decide to learn more abput MLOps as well.

One of the best teachings that come from my university is not to focus on a technology but to understand the need behind it.
The other great lesson from the world of work is that your assessment depends on the things you demonstrate that you are capable of completing.
So for this year I will focus on showing off more projects publicly.


In a nuthshell:

- ⚔️ Skills: MLOps / Time Series Forecasting / Chatbot Development 
- 🎯 My 2024 goal is to build a community of professionals around my YT channel and learn more about DevOps.
