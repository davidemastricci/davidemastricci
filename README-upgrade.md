### Quick glance 🔎
 
 Hi I'm Davide, a Data Scientist with two years of experience in time series analysis. I am passionate about anything related to virtual assistants, chatbots, and NLP and how to use them ethically.
In my spare time, I like to go into details of chatbots and voice-controlled software because I believe that's the present and the near future of human-computer interaction.
 
I was born and raised in 🇮🇹 but surrounded by a international community built thanks to my journeys and foreign experiences.


Bonus Info:

- ⚔️ Skills: Time Series Forecasting / Dialogflow / Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart framework and NLP 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a virtual assistant open source project
